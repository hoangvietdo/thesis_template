This repo contains the template for writing thesis/dissertation.

Current problem that need to be manually fixed:

  1. Words go out of the margin frame.

     Fix: use the command \hyp{} to split the word. For example: 
     ```
     mea\hyp{}ningful.
     ```
  2. Citation indexes are not updated.

     Fix: delete the .bbl and .blg (performance) files and rebuild.
